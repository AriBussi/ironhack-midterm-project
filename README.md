## Challenges on the road
- _**Organizing files!**_ <br/>
It's been a while since I work on a vanilla css and js project and folder structure is not easy to plan.
<br/>

- _**Media queries.**_ <br/>
I still can't decide if I should have a single file for them or not.
<br/>

- _**Assets on the hero section.**_ <br/>
They are not correctly exported from figma and I had to think of a workaround to keep them the right size and look.
